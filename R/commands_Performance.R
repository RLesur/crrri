#' Send the command Performance.disable

#' Disable collecting and reporting metrics.
#' 
#' @param promise An asynchronous result.

#' @return An async value of class `promise`.
#'         The value and the completion of the promise differ according to the value of `awaitResult`.
#'         Its value is a named list of two elements: `ws` (the websocket connexion) and `result`.
#'         When `awaitResult` is `TRUE`, the promise is fulfilled once the result of the command is received. In this case,
#'         `result` is a void named list.
#'         When `awaitResult` is `FALSE`, the promise is fulfilled once the command is sent:

#'         In both cases, you can chain this promise with another command or event listener.
