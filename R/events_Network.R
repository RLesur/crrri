#' Await the event Network.dataReceived or create a callback
#' 
#' **Event description**:  
#' Fired when data chunk was received over the network.
#' 
#' @param promise An asynchronous result object.
#' @param requestId A RequestId. 
#'        Request identifier. Accepted values: `~ .res$requestId` (to refer to the previous result).
#' @param timestamp A MonotonicTime. 
#'        Timestamp. Accepted values: `~ .res$timestamp` (to refer to the previous result).
#' @param dataLength An integer. 
#'        Data chunk length. Accepted values: `~ .res$dataLength` (to refer to the previous result).
#' @param encodedDataLength An integer. 
#'        Actual bytes received (might be less than dataLength for compressed encodings). Accepted values: `~ .res$encodedDataLength` (to refer to the previous result).
#' @param .callback A callback function taking one argument. The object passed to
#'        this function is the message received from Chrome: this is a named list
#'        with an element `method` (that is equal to `"dataReceived"`)
#'        and an element `params` which is a named list.
#'        The `params` list is composed of
#'        the following element(s): `requestId`, `timestamp`, `dataLength`, `encodedDataLength`.
#' 
#' @return An async value of class `promise`.
#'         The value and the completion of the promise differ according to the use of a callback function.
#'         When `.callback` is `NULL`, the promise is fulfilled when the event is received.
#'         Its value is a named list of two elements: `ws` (the websocket connexion) and `result`.
#'         `result` is a named list: its elements are the parameters sended by Chrome. 
#'         You can chain this promise with another command or event listener.
#'         When `.callback` is not `NULL`, the promise is fulfilled as soon as the callback is created; the value
#'         is a function without any argument that can be called to cancel the callback. When you use the

#' Await the event Network.responseReceived or create a callback

#' **Event description**:

#' @param timestamp A MonotonicTime. 
#'        Timestamp. Accepted values: `~ .res$timestamp` (to refer to the previous result).
#' @param type A ResourceType. 
#'        Resource type. Accepted values: `~ .res$type` (to refer to the previous result).

#'        Response data. Accepted values: `~ .res$response` (to refer to the previous result).
#' @param frameId A Page.FrameId. 
#'        Frame identifier. Accepted values: `~ .res$frameId` (to refer to the previous result).
#' @param .callback A callback function taking one argument. The object passed to
