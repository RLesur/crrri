#' Send the command HeadlessExperimental.beginFrame
#' 
#' Sends a BeginFrame to the target and returns when the frame was completed. Optionally captures a
#'        screenshot from the resulting frame. Requires that the target was created with enabled
#'        BeginFrameControl. Designed for use with --run-all-compositor-stages-before-draw, see also
#'        https://goo.gl/3zHXhB for more background.
#' 
#' @param promise An asynchronous result.
#' @param frameTimeTicks Optional. A numeric. 
#'        Timestamp of this BeginFrame in Renderer TimeTicks (milliseconds of uptime). If not set,
#'        the current time will be used. 
#' @param interval Optional. A numeric. 
#'        The interval between BeginFrames that is reported to the compositor, in milliseconds.
#'        Defaults to a 60 frames/second interval, i.e. about 16.666 milliseconds. 
#' @param noDisplayUpdates Optional. A logical. 
#'        Whether updates should not be committed and drawn onto the display. False by default. If
#'        true, only side effects of the BeginFrame will be run, such as layout and animations, but
#'        any visual updates may not be visible on the display or in screenshots. 
#' @param screenshot Optional. A ScreenshotParams. 
#'        If set, a screenshot of the frame will be captured and returned in the response. Otherwise,
#'        no screenshot will be captured. Note that capturing a screenshot can fail, for example,
#'        during renderer initialization. In such a case, no screenshot data will be returned. 
#' @param awaitResult Await for the command result?
#' 
#' @return An async value of class `promise`.
#'         The value and the completion of the promise differ according to the value of `awaitResult`.
#'         Its value is a named list of two elements: `ws` (the websocket connexion) and `result`.
#'         When `awaitResult` is `TRUE`, the promise is fulfilled once the result of the command is received. In this case,
#'         `result` is a named list of length 2.
#'         When `awaitResult` is `FALSE`, the promise is fulfilled once the command is sent:
#'         `result` is equal to the previous result (`promise$result`).
#'         In both cases, you can chain this promise with another command or event listener.
