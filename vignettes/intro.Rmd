The `crrri` package provides a _Chrome Remote Interface_ for R. It is inspired by the node.js module [`chrome-remote-interface`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chrome-remote-interface).

This vignette aims to show several examples of usage for `crrri`.

All the examples come from the [`chrome-remote-interface`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chrome-remote-interface) or [`puppeteer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) documentations. This vignette shows how to reproduce those using `crrri`.

# Setup

You have to set up beforehand the `HEADLESS_CHROME` environment variable to a Chromium/Chrome binary on our system. If you do not, you will need to provide the path to a Chromium/Chrome binary in `Chrome$new()`.  
The [`pagedown`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pagedown) package provides a helper function to retrieve the Chromium/Chrome path on your system: `pagedown::find_chrome()`. So, you can first execute:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.setenv(HEADLESS_CHROME = pagedown::find_chrome())
```

We need to load `crrri` and also `promises` to have the tools to deals with
_promises_ that `crrri` is based on.

```{r}
library(crrri)
library(promises)
```

# Example 1: Take a screenshot

This first example is inspired from this
[post](https://jonathanmh.com/taking-full-page-screenshots-headless-chrome/) that uses the `chrome-remote-interface` node.js package.

The first step is to launch Chromium/Chrome in headless mode:

```{r launch-chrome, results='hide'}
chrome <- Chrome$new()
```

Then connect R to headless Chromium/Chrome with the `connect()` method. Since the connection process is not immediate, the `connect()` method returns a promise that is fulfilled when R is connected to Chrome. The value of this promise is the connection object.

```{r connect}
client <- chrome$connect()
```

You need to write a function whose first parameter will receive the `client` connection object.
```{r screenshot-fn}
screenshot_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".png")

screenshot <- function(client) {
  # some constants
  targetUrl <- "https://cran.rstudio.com"
  viewport <- c(1440, 900)
  screenshotDelay <- 2 # seconds

  # extract the domain you need
  Page <- client$Page
  Emulation <- client$Emulation

  # enable events for the Page, DOM and Network domains 
  Page$enable() %...>% {
    # modify the viewport settings
    Emulation$setDeviceMetricsOverride(
      width = viewport[1],
      height = viewport[2],
      deviceScaleFactor = 0,
      mobile = FALSE,
      dontSetVisibleSize = FALSE
    )
  } %...>% {
    # go to url
    Page$navigate(targetUrl)
    # wait the page is loaded
    Page$loadEventFired()
  } %>% 
    # add a delay 
    wait(delay = screenshotDelay) %...>% {
    # capture screenshot
    Page$captureScreenshot(format = "png", fromSurface = TRUE)
  } %...>% {
    .$data %>% 
      jsonlite::base64_dec() %>% 
      writeBin(screenshot_file)
  } %>%
  # close headless chrome (client connections are safely closed)
  finally(
    ~ client$disconnect()
  ) %...!% {
    cat("Error:", .$message, "\n")
  }
}
```

Therefore, you can take a screenshot by executing this `screenshot()` function:

```{r chrome-screenshot, eval=FALSE}
client %...>% screenshot()
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# since screenshot returns an invisible promise, we have to force await 
await(client %...>% screenshot())
```

The screenshot is written to disk and looks like this:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
img <- magick::image_read(screenshot_file)
magick::image_scale(img, "400")
```

# Example 2: Dump HTML after page loaded

This example is inspired from this [JavaScript script](https://github.com/cyrus-and/chrome-remote-interface/wiki/Dump-HTML-after-page-load) from the `chrome-remote-interface` wiki that dumps the DOM.

```{r dump-dom-fun}
html_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".html")

client <- chrome$connect()

dump_DOM <- function(client) {
  Network <- client$Network
  Page <- client$Page
  Runtime <- client$Runtime
  Network$enable() %...>%
  { Page$enable() } %...>%
  { Network$setCacheDisabled(cacheDisabled = TRUE) } %...>% 
  { Page$navigate(url = "https://github.com") } %...>%
  { Page$loadEventFired() } %...>% { 
    Runtime$evaluate(
      expression = 'document.documentElement.outerHTML'
    ) 
  } %...>% {
    writeLines(c(.$result$value, "\n"), con = html_file) 
  } %>%
  finally(
    ~ client$disconnect()
  ) %...!% {
    cat("Error:", .$message, "\n")
  }
}
```

Execute the task:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
client %...>% dump_DOM()
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# since dump_dom is an invisible promise, we have to force await 
await(client %...>% dump_DOM())
chrome$close()
```

Here is the first 20 lines of what we get in `html_file`:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(paste0(
  c("```html", readLines(html_file, n = 20), "```"), 
  collapse = "\n"
))
```

This could be useful to parse HTML with `rvest` after a page is loaded.
