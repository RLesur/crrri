\title{Await the event Page.frameScheduledNavigation or create a callback}
\usage{
Page.frameScheduledNavigation(promise, frameId = NULL, delay = NULL,
  reason = NULL, url = NULL, .callback = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{promise}{An asynchronous result object.}

\item{frameId}{A FrameId.
Id of the frame that has scheduled a navigation. Accepted values: \code{~ .res$frameId} (to refer to the previous result).}

\item{delay}{A numeric.
Delay (in seconds) until the navigation is scheduled to begin. The navigation is not
guaranteed to start. Accepted values: \code{~ .res$delay} (to refer to the previous result).}

\item{reason}{A character string.
The reason for the navigation. Accepted values: \code{~ .res$reason} (to refer to the previous result), formSubmissionGet, formSubmissionPost, httpHeaderRefresh, scriptInitiated, metaTagRefresh, pageBlockInterstitial, reload.}

\item{url}{A character string.
The destination URL for the scheduled navigation. Accepted values: \code{~ .res$url} (to refer to the previous result).}

\item{.callback}{A callback function taking one argument. The object passed to
this function is the message received from Chrome: this is a named list
with an element \code{method} (that is equal to \code{"frameScheduledNavigation"})
and an element \code{params} which is a named list.
The \code{params} list is composed of
the following element(s): \code{frameId}, \code{delay}, \code{reason}, \code{url}.}
}
\value{
An async value of class \code{promise}.
The value and the completion of the promise differ according to the use of a callback function.
When \code{.callback} is \code{NULL}, the promise is fulfilled when the event is received.
Its value is a named list of two elements: \code{ws} (the websocket connexion) and \code{result}.
\code{result} is a named list: its elements are the parameters sended by Chrome.
You can chain this promise with another command or event listener.
When \code{.callback} is not \code{NULL}, the promise is fulfilled as soon as the callback is created; the value
is a function without any argument that can be called to cancel the callback. When you use the
\code{.callback} argument, you cannot send the result to any other command or event listener.
