\title{Send the command HeadlessExperimental.beginFrame}
\usage{
HeadlessExperimental.beginFrame(promise, frameTimeTicks = NULL,
  interval = NULL, noDisplayUpdates = NULL, screenshot = NULL,
  awaitResult = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{promise}{An asynchronous result.}

\item{frameTimeTicks}{Optional. A numeric.
Timestamp of this BeginFrame in Renderer TimeTicks (milliseconds of uptime). If not set,
the current time will be used.}

\item{interval}{Optional. A numeric.
The interval between BeginFrames that is reported to the compositor, in milliseconds.
Defaults to a 60 frames/second interval, i.e. about 16.666 milliseconds.}

\item{noDisplayUpdates}{Optional. A logical.
Whether updates should not be committed and drawn onto the display. False by default. If
true, only side effects of the BeginFrame will be run, such as layout and animations, but
any visual updates may not be visible on the display or in screenshots.}

\item{screenshot}{Optional. A ScreenshotParams.
If set, a screenshot of the frame will be captured and returned in the response. Otherwise,
no screenshot will be captured. Note that capturing a screenshot can fail, for example,
during renderer initialization. In such a case, no screenshot data will be returned.}

\item{awaitResult}{Await for the command result?}
}
\value{
An async value of class \code{promise}.
The value and the completion of the promise differ according to the value of \code{awaitResult}.
Its value is a named list of two elements: \code{ws} (the websocket connexion) and \code{result}.
When \code{awaitResult} is \code{TRUE}, the promise is fulfilled once the result of the command is received. In this case,
\code{result} is a named list of length 2.
When \code{awaitResult} is \code{FALSE}, the promise is fulfilled once the command is sent:
\code{result} is equal to the previous result (\code{promise$result}).
In both cases, you can chain this promise with another command or event listener.
}
\description{
Sends a BeginFrame to the target and returns when the frame was completed. Optionally captures a
screenshot from the resulting frame. Requires that the target was created with enabled
BeginFrameControl. Designed for use with --run-all-compositor-stages-before-draw, see also
