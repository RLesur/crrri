\title{Await the event Security.securityStateChanged or create a callback}
\usage{
Security.securityStateChanged(promise, securityState = NULL,
  schemeIsCryptographic = NULL, explanations = NULL,
  insecureContentStatus = NULL, summary = NULL, .callback = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{promise}{An asynchronous result object.}

\item{securityState}{A SecurityState.
Security state. Accepted values: \code{~ .res$securityState} (to refer to the previous result).}

\item{schemeIsCryptographic}{A logical.
True if the page was loaded over cryptographic transport such as HTTPS. Accepted values: \code{~ .res$schemeIsCryptographic} (to refer to the previous result).}

\item{explanations}{A list of SecurityStateExplanation.
List of explanations for the security state. If the overall security state is \code{insecure} or
\code{warning}, at least one corresponding explanation should be included. Accepted values: \code{~ .res$explanations} (to refer to the previous result).}

\item{insecureContentStatus}{A InsecureContentStatus.
Information about insecure content on the page. Accepted values: \code{~ .res$insecureContentStatus} (to refer to the previous result).}

\item{summary}{A character string.
Overrides user-visible description of the state. Accepted values: \code{~ .res$summary} (to refer to the previous result).}

\item{.callback}{A callback function taking one argument. The object passed to
this function is the message received from Chrome: this is a named list
with an element \code{method} (that is equal to \code{"securityStateChanged"})
and an element \code{params} which is a named list.
The \code{params} list is composed of
the following element(s): \code{securityState}, \code{schemeIsCryptographic}, \code{explanations}, \code{insecureContentStatus}, \code{summary} (optional) .}
}
\value{
An async value of class \code{promise}.
The value and the completion of the promise differ according to the use of a callback function.
When \code{.callback} is \code{NULL}, the promise is fulfilled when the event is received.
Its value is a named list of two elements: \code{ws} (the websocket connexion) and \code{result}.
\code{result} is a named list: its elements are the parameters sended by Chrome.
You can chain this promise with another command or event listener.
When \code{.callback} is not \code{NULL}, the promise is fulfilled as soon as the callback is created; the value
is a function without any argument that can be called to cancel the callback. When you use the
\code{.callback} argument, you cannot send the result to any other command or event listener.
