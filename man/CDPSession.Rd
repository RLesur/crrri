\title{Connect to a remote instance implementing the Chrome Debugging Protocol}
\usage{
CDPSession(host = "localhost", port = 9222, secure = FALSE,
  ws_url = NULL, local = FALSE, callback = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{host}{Character scalar, the host name of the application.}

\item{port}{The remote debugging port (a numeric or a character scalar).}

\item{secure}{A logical indicating whether a secure protocol shall be used.}

\item{ws_url}{Character scalar, the websocket URL. If provided, \code{host} and
\code{port} arguments are ignored.}

\item{local}{Logical scalar, indicating whether the local version of the
protocol (embedded in \code{crrri}) must be used or the protocol must be
fetched \emph{remotely}.}

\item{callback}{Function with one argument, executed when the R session is
connected to Chrome. The connection object is passed to this function.}
}
\value{
The returned value depends on the value of the \code{callback} argument.
When \code{callback} is a function, the returned value is a connection object
of class \code{CDPSession}. When \code{callback} is \code{NULL} the returned value is
a promise which becomes fulfilled once R is connected to the remote
instance. Once fulfilled, the value of this promise is the connection
object of class \code{CDPSession}.
}
\description{
This function creates a websocket connection to a remote instance using
the Chrome Debugging Protocol.
