\name{Fetch.takeResponseBodyAsStream}
\alias{Fetch.takeResponseBodyAsStream}
\title{Send the command Fetch.takeResponseBodyAsStream}
\usage{
Fetch.takeResponseBodyAsStream(promise, requestId, awaitResult = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{promise}{An asynchronous result.}

\item{requestId}{A RequestId.}

\item{awaitResult}{Await for the command result?}
}
\value{
An async value of class \code{promise}.
The value and the completion of the promise differ according to the value of \code{awaitResult}.
Its value is a named list of two elements: \code{ws} (the websocket connexion) and \code{result}.
When \code{awaitResult} is \code{TRUE}, the promise is fulfilled once the result of the command is received. In this case,
\code{result} is a named list of length 1.
When \code{awaitResult} is \code{FALSE}, the promise is fulfilled once the command is sent:
\code{result} is equal to the previous result (\code{promise$result}).
In both cases, you can chain this promise with another command or event listener.
}
\description{
Returns a handle to the stream representing the response body.
The request must be paused in the HeadersReceived stage.
Note that after this command the request can't be continued
as is -- client either needs to cancel it or to provide the
response body.
The stream only supports sequential read, IO.read will fail if the position
is specified.
This method is mutually exclusive with getResponseBody.
Calling other methods that affect the request or disabling fetch
domain before body is received results in an undefined behavior.
